## About
Intelligent framework for designing artificial neural networks is an ostis-system designed with [OSTIS Technology principles](https://github.com/ostis-ai) in mind.

## Run documentation

```sh
#Terminal
cd ostis-ann
pip3 install mkdocs markdown-include mkdocs-material mkdocs-i18n
mkdocs serve
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8002/ in your browser


## Requirements
You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) (with Compose plugin) installed and running on your machine. 

We recommend using Docker Desktop on [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) / [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) and using [Docker Server](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server) distribution for your Linux distribution of choice. Use installation instructions provided in the links above.
## Installation

```sh
git clone -c core.longpaths=true -c core.autocrlf=true https://github.com/ostis-apps/ostis-ann
cd ostis-ann
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker compose build
```

## üöÄ Usage
- Launch
  ```sh
  docker compose up -d
  ```
    This command will launch Web UI on your machine: 
  - sc-web - `localhost:8000`
- Stop
  ```sh
  docker compose down
  ``` 
   
We've set our system to rebuild KB on each restart. If you're debugging some specific subset of your knowledge base you may want to change repo.path to exclude the folders you don't need. 

If you do not want to rebuild KB on relaunch, you can comment out the `REBUILD_KB` environment variable in `docker-compose.yml`.
You can use `docker compose run --rm problem-solver build` to rebuild KB manually.

## Troubleshooting
Windows-specific problems:
- Docker images built on your computer are not launching correctly and logging something along these lines: `bash\r: No such file or directory`
  
  **Solution**: please make sure your Git repo is configured to be compatible UNIX line endings
  ```sh
  cd ostis-ann
  git config --local core.autocrlf true
  ```
- Git cannot clone repos or submodules, error looks like `error: unable to create file ... (file too long)`

  **Solution**: please make sure your Git repo has `longpaths` config option enabled:
  ```sh
  cd ostis-ann
  git config --local core.longpaths true
  ```
Common issues:
- Docker images cannot be built locally. Error: `status: the --mount option requires BuildKit` 
  
  **Solution**: Please note that you'd only need it for custom images, you can launch our system without building images yourself. Use the [Docker Docs BuildKit reference](https://docs.docker.com/go/buildkit) to enable Docker BuildKit on your computer. **In case you're using Windows**, you could use `$env:DOCKER_BUILDKIT = 1` while building in PowerShell.

- Help! My problem-solver container is `unhealthy`
  
  Looks like your container didn't start properly. There are two main reasons for this: violated `start_period` (in case it naturally takes a lot of time to launch our system on your hardware) or faulty server instance. Since there are 2 reasons to this problem, we'll provide 2 solutions. 
  
  **Solution 1**: Increasing `start_period` in `docker-compose.yml` might help you.

  **Solution 2**: Check [known issues](https://github.com/ostis-apps/ostis-ann/issues), and in case your problem is not reported yet, create a new one!
